# Overview

This project is created to help deepen an understanding of TypeScript basics. As a software engineer, I aim to improve my TypeScript programming skills by building a simple program that outputs "Hello World" using pnpm for project management and dependency installation

# Development Environment

To build this project, I used these tools:

npm: I used this to install pnpm on my computer.
pnpm: It helped me set up the project and manage all the files I need, including typescript and ts-node.
Typescript: This is the programming language I used to make the software.
visual studio code: This i used as workspace to develop the project.
